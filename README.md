##  Tech Stack

### Front end built using: React/Redux, MapBox/ReactMap-Gl

#### _Front end framework goes here_

üö´ Why did you choose this framework?

-   React/Redux was used for reusable and to create a large web application that can exchange data fast and simple.
-   Mapbox so we could gain the mapping skills and marker placements that is coupled with the ReactMap-gl.


üö´List the rest of the front end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above.

#### Front end deployed to `Heroku`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/geoseek-be) built using:

#### üö´ back end framework goes here: Nodejs

-    fast deployment to get product to users.
-    point two
-    point three

-   Express, Knex, PostgreSQL for DB



# APIs

##  Authentication API here

JWT

#  Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products
