#  Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:


    *  REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
